## 📝 Project Summary
This project involves the development of a mobile application—designed with the capability to migrate easily to the web—to manage orders in the hospitality sector. The goal is to optimize service time, reduce errors, and improve overall business organization in an increasingly demanding digital market.

## 🚀 Key Features
The application includes several core modules for restaurant administration:
* **User Management:** Secure login and registration systems to control access.
* **Table Management:** Ability to create, edit, delete, and visualize the status (Available/Occupied) of the business's tables.
* **Product & Menu Management:** A digital menu organized by categories with details on ingredients, allergens, and pricing. Categories can be personalized with specific colors.
* **Order Management (Comandas):** Real-time recording of orders for each table with status tracking (Pending, Preparing, Ready, Delivered).
* **Invoice Generation:** An automated billing system that summarizes orders for a final price per table, allowing users to mark them as paid.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
* **Frontend:** Developed using **React Native** and **TypeScript** for cross-platform mobile compatibility.
* **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS** (via Nativewind) for a responsive and intuitive interface.
* **Backend:** Built with **Spring Boot** and **Java** to provide a secure and scalable server.
* **Database:** **MySQL** relational database for persistent data storage.
* **Security:** Implementation of **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** for user identification and secure requests.

## 📅 Methodology
The development followed the **Scrum** agile methodology, organized into iterative sprints to deliver incremental value throughout the project. **Git** and **GitHub** were used for version control.

## 💻 System Requirements
* **Operating System:** Windows 10+, macOS 12+, or Linux (Ubuntu/Fedora).
* **Hardware:** Intel Core i7 (10th/11th Gen) or equivalent, 8GB RAM, and 25GB free storage.
